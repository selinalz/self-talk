        Tobyn Bell still remembers the precise moment when his self-compassion practice paid off. <br> <br>

       	He had just arrived home from work and was turning over in his mind the mistakes he had made that day, what he could or should have done – the kind of self-critical thoughts he had struggled with for years. Then, unexpectedly, another voice piped up. in response, calm and steadying, addressing Bell by a fond nickname from his childhood. <br> <br>

         While training to be a mental health nurse, Bell had learned tactics to counter and give context to his inner critic. In that otherwise mundane moment, when his internal monologue leapt to meet cruelty with kindness, they were revealed to have been effective. <br> <br>

        Many of us may see <span class="underline">self-compassion</span><sup>1</sup> as akin to mindfulness or gratitude: a worthy goal that is hard to turn into a habitual practice. But, as Bell’s example shows, it is possible to change our inner monologue, with benefits for not only our individual health and happiness, but perhaps that of society. <br> <br>

        By fostering compassion for ourselves, experts say, we are more readily able to feel it for other people, meaning our kinder, calmer, more empathic approach can radiate outwards. With more months of lockdown looming, with all the uncertainty and unhappiness that is likely to bring, changing your inner monologue is one small – and, crucially, free – step towards looking after your mental health. <br> <br>

      <div class="title2"> Do You Find Your Self-Talk Irrational, Unrealistic And Often Negative? </div>

      <div class="body2">

        If so, you are your own worst enemy. According to <span class="underline2">Selye</span><sup>2</sup>, "It is not what happens to a man but how he takes it". In other words, it is not the situation that makes us mad or emotional; the way we think about an event-our self-talk can create our own emotions, either pleasant or unpleasant. Think about it. <br> <br>

        The three most common forms of negative talk are awfulistic, absolutistic, and should-have self- talk. Sometimes the categories- and the emotions the talk arouses-overlap. But they are also very distinct. <br> <br>

        <span class="body-bold"> AWFULISTIC SELF-TALK </span> is a way of viewing everything as catastrophic. If your manager questions you about the way you would handle a situation, you may say to yourself, "She doesn't think I'm a good employee" or "She's trying to get rid of me." If a coworker doesn't speak to you, awfulistic self-talk impels you to think, "She's angry with me" or "He doesn't want to work with me." When you hear that your spouse is going away on business for a few days, you say, "Being alone is just awful!" <br> <br>

        <span class="body-bold"> ABSOLUTISTIC SELF-TALK </span> is the use of words like "must," "always," or "never." If you tell yourself, "I must always [a double no-no] know the answer to a question or people will think I'm stupid," or "I'll never be able to do everything I have to do today," you are putting unrealistic pressure on yourself. <br> <br>

        Should-have self-talk is a way of making yourself feel guilty. “ Today is Friday and I should have called on Wednesday." Because you can't change the fact you are only driving yourself crazy with such self-talk. Don't do that! <br> <br>

        We can all relearn how to talk to ourselves positively, rationally, and realistically. Optimistic, nowistic, and realistic self-talk can make you feel positive about situations, happy, and in control. <br> <br>

        <span class="body-bold"> OPTIMISTIC SELF-TALK </span> is putting your thoughts in the most positive way. For example, if your spouse is going on a short business trip you may say, "While he is away, I'll accomplish something" or "It will be great to spend some time with my friend Jenny." <br> <br>

        If your manager asks you about the way you would handle a situation, you say to yourself, "She is asking me so that she can evaluate my skills better or so she can help me enhance my professional growth, I don't need to worry." <br> <br>

        <span class="body-bold"> REALISTIC SELF-TALK </span> is a way to view things objectively. If a colleague doesn't speak to you, you don't imagine the worst. Instead you reflect, "Nancy did not speak to me today. I wonder if something is troubling her. I'll speak with her at break." It's a way of not being hard on yourself. "If I don't know the answer, I will look it up or find someone to ask." <br> <br>

        <span class="body-bold"> NOWISTIC SELF-TALK </span> is a way to remain in the present, to do what is possible in the here and now. Don't dwell on what could have or should have been done. <br> <br>

        Self-talk is automatic and reflexive in nature. But we can learn to change how we talk to ourselves and, therefore, how we react to events. Change, however, requires effort. One exercise is to write down your feelings about a common situation that produces unpleasant emotions. <br> <br> <br> <br>
