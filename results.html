        Your self-talk is already very optimistic, realistic, and nowistic. Congratulations. <br> <br>
        <span class="subtitle"> > 11-20 </span>
        You may have realistic problems with your manager that you need to iron out. Monitor your own thoughts in the next five ex- changes with her and see if you detect a pattern of your own that you can correct. <br> <br>
        <span class="subtitle"> > ABOVE 20 </span>
        Try and silently monitor at least four exchanges daily with everyone. This will help you start break from your own awfulistic, absolutistic self-talk.
