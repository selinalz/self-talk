        <div class="title"> Harnessing Language to Promote Self-Regulation </div>
      
        <div class="body"> 

          Several lines of research motivate this prediction. First, converging evidence suggests that enhancing psychological distance, which we construed broadly as the capacity to transcend one’s egocentric viewpoint of a stimulus, facilitates self-regulation. <br> <br>

          The concept of self-distancing also factors prominently into several cognitive and behavioral treatment paradigms. <span class="underline">Beck</span><sup>3</sup> also described distancing as a process that allows clients to think objectively about irrational thoughts and emphasized the importance of this process for effective cognitive therapy. The concept of distancing, although sometimes referred to as “decentering” or “self as context,” is also central to many newer forms of cognitive therapy, which emphasize the importance of enhancing psychological distance from the self for allowing people to observe and accept their feelings. <br> <br>

          These findings are noteworthy in the current context because researchers have speculated that the language people use to refer to the self may influence self-distancing. For example, research on expressive writing conceptualizes the degree of first-person pronouns that people use when writing about emotional experiences as a marker of self-distancing—the fewer first-person pronouns people use, the more people attempt to distance themselves from their experiences. Supporting this inference, cueing people to reflect on emotional and nonemotional  experiences from the visual perspective of a psychologically distanced observer (compared with a first-person visual perspective) leads them to describe these experiences using fewer first-person pronouns. <br> <br>

          Why might certain patterns of language use, in particular people’s use of non-first-person pronouns and their own name to refer to the self, promote self-distancing? In general, people use these parts of speech when thinking about, referencing, or speaking to other people. Thus, if people use these parts of speech to refer to the self, this may enhance self-distancing by leading people to think about themselves as though they were someone else—albeit another self whose inner thoughts and feelings they have privileged access to. In contrast, people virtually exclusively use first person pronouns when thinking about or referring to the self from their egocentric point of view. Thus, people who use these parts of speech during introspection should think about the self as they normally do— from a self-immersed, first-person perspective. <br> <br>

          In sum, our analysis suggests that the language people use to refer to the self during introspection may influence self-distancing, and thus have consequential implications for their ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior under stress. Our first goal was to explore this question. <br> <br>

        <div class="title2"> Exploring Generalizability to Vulnerable Populations: Social Anxiety </div>

        <div class="body2">

          Our second goal was to explore whether social anxiety moderates the self-regulatory benefits of non-first-person language use during introspection. We focused on social anxiety because it can be studied in the laboratory with a high degree of ecological validity. That is, the situations that socially anxious people fear most—being evaluated by others in a social context—can be simulated in the laboratory relatively easily, in ways that lend themselves well to testing predictions about mechanisms underlying self-regulation. Moreover, social anxiety is one of the most common forms of anxiety. From the apprehensive partygoer to the anxious public speaker to the socially phobic patient, countless people experience social anxiety and the concomitant negative psychological and physical consequences that it generates. <br> <br>

          Cognitive models of social anxiety suggest that socially anxious individuals experience high levels of anxiety in response to the threat of future social interactions. When these situations are possible, they worry excessively about the likelihood of performing poorly, which interferes a lot with their performance. The perception and actuality of their poor performance reinforce their negative beliefs about the self, giving rise to maladaptive postevent processing or rumination. <br> <br>

          In current cognitive behavioral therapies, social anxiety is treated by challenging negative expectations about upcoming events. However, to the extent that the language people use to refer to the self during introspection influences self-regulation, it might provide an additional (potentially easily implemented) tool for helping vulnerable populations cope with social threat. <br> <br>

        <div class="title3"> Research Overview </div>

        <div class="body3">

          Does the language people use to refer to the self during introspection influence how they think, feel, and behave under social stress? If so, do these effects extend to socially anxious people who are particularly vulnerable to such stress? <br> <br>

          Seven studies examined whether language use during introspection influences people’s ability to self-regulate under social stress. Studies 1a and 1b were proof-of-principle studies. They examined whether using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name (non-first-person group from hereon) rather than first-person pro- nouns (first-person group from hereon) during introspection enhances self-distancing. Studies 2 and 3 then examined the implications of these different forms of self-talk for regulating the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral sequalae of social stress. Studies 4 and 5 examined how these different forms of self-talk influence the way people appraise future stressors. Finally, Study 6 consisted of a meta-analysis that combined data from Studies 2 through 5 to examine whether trait social anxiety moderates the self-regulatory effects of non-first-person language use and adoption. <br> <br>

          Together, these findings demonstrate that small shifts in the language people use to refer to the self during introspection consequentially influence their ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior under social stress, even for vulnerable individuals. <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title4"> Studies 1a and 1b </div>

        <div class="body4">

          Our starting point is that using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name to refer to the self during introspection promotes self-distancing. One way to test this prediction is to examine whether language use during self-reflection influences the vantage point that people adopt when visualizing emotional experiences. If non-first-person language use (i.e., “linguistic” self-distancing) enhances self-distancing, then people who use this type of language during introspection should be more likely to report seeing themselves in their past experience from an observer’s visual perspective (i.e., “visual” self-distancing) than people who use first-person pronouns during introspection. This logic is broadly consistent with construal level theory, which suggests that potentiating psychological distance in one domain enhances psychological distance in other domains. <br> <br>

          We tested this prediction by asking participants to analyze their feelings surrounding an anger-provoking (Study 1a) and anxiety- provoking (Study 1b) negative autobiographical experience using first-person pronouns or non-first-person pronouns and their own name. We focused on two types of negative emotional experiences in these studies to examine the reliability and generalizability of our findings. After participants analyzed their feelings/emotions, we asked them to indicate the degree to which they adopted the visual perspective of an observer as they reflected on their feelings/emotions. <br> <br>

          Visual self-distancing. As expected, participants in the non-first-person groups displayed significantly higher levels of visual self-distancing than participants in the first-person groups in both Study 1a and Study 1b. These findings demonstrate that using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name to refer to the self enhances this self-distancing we have been talking about. <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title6"> Studies 2 and 3: Overview </div>

        <div class="body6">

          Having established that using non-first-person language to refer to the self during introspection increases self-distancing, we examined in Studies 2 and 3 whether language use during introspection influences self-regulation under social stress. Both Studies 2 and 3 focused on these same core issues but were designed by different laboratories and implemented independently for each experiment. As a result, they had similar procedures and focused on a partially overlapping set of dependent variables. Thus, they provide convergent evidence for the role that language use plays in self-regulation across different situations, laboratories, and measures. <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title7"> Study 2 </div>

        <div class="body7">

          We recruited participants for a study on the psychology of first impressions. They were told that they would be asked to make a positive first impression on another person. Prior to engaging in this task, we asked them to reflect on their feelings concerning their upcoming social interaction using either first-person pro-nouns or non-first-person pronouns and their own name. We then examined the effect of this manipulation on participants’ anxiety and performance during the social interaction. We predicted that participants in the non-first-person group would experience less anxiety and perform better during the impression formation task.  <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title8"> Results </div>

        <div class="body8">

          Study 2 examined whether the language people use to refer to the self during introspection influences how they feel and behave under social stress. It generated three key findings. <br> <br>

          First, both groups were equally capable of implementing the self-talk manipulations. This suggests that using non-first-person language during introspection is a feasible alternative to using first-person language. <br> <br>

          Second, contrary to our expectations, condition did not influence the increase in anxiety participants reported from the first to the second assessment. However, condition did predict changes in anxiety from the second to the third anxiety assessment, indicating that participants in the non-first-person group (compared with the first-person group) displayed a sharper decrease in anxiety from before to after the social interaction. This finding is particularly noteworthy because it suggests that using non-first-person language to refer to the self during introspection may lead people to recover more quickly from social stressors. <br> <br>

          Finally, the experimental manipulation influenced participants’ behavior and actions during the social interaction. Judges indicated that participants in the non-first-person group were less nervous during the interaction and performed better than their first-person counter- parts. These findings highlight the adaptive behavioral implications that using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name during introspection have for people when they engage in tasks that elicit social stress. <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title9"> Study 3 </div>

        <div class="body9">

          Study 3 examined the implications of the same two types of self-talk that Study 2 focused on for allowing people to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior under social evaluative stress. However, a different social stress induction was used, the focus was on different dependent variables, and men as well as women were included. In so doing, we aimed in Study 3 to extend the Study 2 findings in four ways. <br> <br>

          First, in Study 3, we examined whether the Study 2 results would generalize to an arguably more powerful social stress induction—a public speech task rather than an impression formation task. Building on prior research indicating that visual self- distancing manipulations generalize to powerful negative affect inductions, we predicted that the benefits associated with using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name during introspection would generalize to this novel context. <br> <br>

          Second, although Study 2 included a premanipulation measure of affect that the two groups did not differ on, this measure was administered after participants were informed about the nature of the study. Thus, one could argue that the premanipulation anxiety measure used in Study 2 did not constitute a true baseline measure because anxiety was likely induced to a certain degree among all participants. Study 3 included a true baseline affect measure that was administered before participants learned about the nature of the study itself. <br> <br>

          Third, whereas Study 2 focused specifically on anxiety, Study 3 included measures of both global affect and shame. Shame is the key discrete emotion elicited by public speech tasks. <br> <br>

          Finally, prior research indicates that people often perseverate over their performance in social-anxiety-provoking tasks, which fuels social anxiety—a process that is often referred to as postevent processing. Therefore, Study 3 included multiple measures of postevent processing to examine whether the experimental manipulations influenced this variable. To the extent that reflecting on the self using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name enhances people’s ability to regulate their social anxiety, we predicted that participants who engaged in this process should also display less postevent processing. <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title10"> Results </div>

        <div class="body10">

          In sum, participants who used non-first-person pronouns and their own name during introspection performed better on the speech task, experienced less global negative affect and shame after delivering their speech, and engaged in less postevent processing. These findings extend the Study 2 results in three ways. <br> <br>

          First, they demonstrate that non-first-person language use during introspection promotes self-regulation under conditions that are well known to arouse both psychological and physiological stress—an anxiety-provoking public-speaking challenge. Second, they demonstrate that language use during self-reflection has implications not simply for how people think and feel in the moment but also for their tendency to engage in postevent processing. This finding is particularly noteworthy given the role that postevent processing plays as a risk factor for poor psychological  and physical health, and its prevalence in social phobia. Finally, controlling for gender did not alter any of the results we observed. This suggests that the benefits associated with language use as a tool for promoting self-regulation may extend to both genders. Future research that includes larger samples of men is needed, however, to further confirm this finding.  <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title11"> Study 4 </div>

        <div class="body11">

          Study 4 had three goals. Its first goal was to examine how language use during introspection influences people’s appraisals of future stressors. In particular, it sought to examine the effect of language use on challenge-threat appraisals. <br> <br>

          People naturally appraise future stressors along a challenge – threat continuum. Challenge appraisals occur when people perceive their ability to cope (i.e., their resources/assets) with a situation as exceeding the demands of the situation; threat appraisals occur when people perceive the demands of the situation as exceeding their ability to cope regularly. <br> <br>

          In the current study, we hypothesized that non-first-person language use would lead people to appraise future stressors in more challenging and less threatening terms. This prediction was motivated by research indicating that visual self-distancing leads people to focus relatively less on the concrete, emotionally arousing aspects of negative past experiences and relatively more on reconstruing their experiences in ways that provide insight and closure. In the current context, we reasoned that focusing on the concrete, emotionally arousing aspects of a future stressful experience are precisely those elements of the situation that should lead a person to conclude that the demands of the situation outweigh his or her ability to cope—i.e., less challenge and more threat. The primary goal of Study 5 was to test this hypothesis we've predicted. <br> <br>

          A secondary goal was to rule out two alternative predictions concerning how language use influences the way people cognitively represent future stressors. First, we examined the relation- ship between language use during introspection and cognitive avoidance—that is, avoiding cognitions that give rise to anxiety. We focused on this relationship because a number of researchers have speculated that self-distancing blunts emotional reactions via a cognitive avoidance mechanism. <br> <br>

          Another possibility is that non-first-person language use enhances people’s tendency to imagine how they appear from the perspective of the audience/viewer evaluating them. This prediction is motivated by research indicating that psychological-distancing manipulations can enhance perspective taking. Although there is conflicting evidence on whether such perspective taking is helpful or harmful, we nevertheless examined whether non-first-person language use enhances audience perspective taking to examine the role that this process plays in the phenomenon at hand. <br> <br>

          The final goal of this study was to examine the reliability of our failure to observe an effect of language use on anticipatory anxiety in Study 2. As noted previously, this null effect was unexpected. Thus, we measured anticipatory anxiety again in this study to examine whether it would replicate. <br> <br>

          We examined these issues using a modified version of the speech task paradigm used in Study 3. Specifically, we replicated the Study 3 procedure with the following exceptions. After participants reflected on their feelings, we asked them to rate the extent to which they appraised the upcoming speech task as a challenge or threat, and their current level of anticipatory anxiety. We then asked participants to describe in writing the stream of thoughts that flowed through their mind during the reflection period and coded these essays for challenge–threat appraisals, avoidance, and audience perspective taking. <br> <br>

          After participants completed the writing task, they were in- formed that the study was over and debriefed. We did not have participants deliver their speech because we felt that asking participants to answer each of the aforementioned questions and then describe in writing how they thought about their experience would compromise the downstream effects of the manipulations, muddying the conclusions we could draw about outcomes that were measured subsequently.  <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title12"> Results </div>

        <div class="body12">

          In Study 4, we examined whether the language people use to reflect on their anxious feelings when preparing to give a public speech alters the way they appraise that event. It generated four key findings. <br> <br>

          First, as predicted, participants who reflected on their feelings using non-first-person language appraised their upcoming speech in more challenging and less threatening terms than participants who reflected on their feelings using first-person language. This effect was observed on two types of appraisal measures, highlight- ing the robustness of these results. These findings are noteworthy because prior research indicates that challenge–threat appraisals influence how people think, feel, and behave under social stress. Specifically, challenge (compared with threat) appraisals predict adaptive subjective, physiological, and behavioral responses. <br> <br>

          Second, in contrast to the Study 2 results but consistent with our initial predictions, non-first-person participants displayed less anticipatory anxiety than first-person participants. Thus, it is possible that our failure to observe an effect on anticipatory anxiety in Study 2 was due to chance. Given that we expected and found an effect of condition on this variable in Study 4, we caution against overinterpreting the null results in Study 2. <br> <br>

          Finally, virtually no one avoided focusing on their feelings and emotions. This is consistent with research indicating that adopting a visual self- distanced perspective to analyze one’s feelings does not promote cognitive avoidance. We also failed to find a significant effect of language use on audience perspective taking, which suggests that using non first person language to reflect on one’s feelings does not differentially prime people to think about how they appear in the eyes of others compared to first person language use. These findings, in conjunction with the aforementioned challenge–threat appraisal results, begin to demonstrate how non-first-person language use does and does not influence the way people think about future anxiety- provoking stressors. <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title13"> Study 5 </div>

        <div class="body13">

          The primary goal in Study 5 was to conceptually replicate the effect of language use on challenge–threat appraisals using a larger sample from a different participant pool. We accomplished this goal by recruiting participants using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. <br> <br>

          The second goal was to examine the generalizability of the effect of language use on challenge–threat appraisals. Toward this end, we asked participants to reflect on their feelings surrounding any future anxiety-provoking event (not just a speech task). <br> <br>

          Our final goal was to refine our understanding on how language use influences challenge–threat appraisals by more directly assess- ing the relationship between these variables. In Study 4, challenge–threat appraisals were measured by asking participants to self-report how they appraised their upcoming speech task and then retrospectively report on the stream of thoughts that flowed through their mind when they analyzed their feelings. Although both of these are valid measures that are regularly used to interpret how people appraise events, they are both one step removed from the appraisal process itself. That is, they do not directly assess the thoughts and feelings that become activated when people reflect on events. To directly assess such thoughts, we implemented an alternative approach in Study 5 that involved asking participants to work through their current thoughts and feelings surrounding an upcoming anxiety event in writing using first-person or non-first-person language. By having people write about their thoughts and feelings as they experienced them, we hoped to obtain a direct window into how the language manipulations influence the way people appraise upcoming social stressors. <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title14"> Results </div>

        <div class="body14">

          These findings conceptually replicate the Study 4 results. They also demonstrate that the effect of language use on challenge – threat appraisals generalizes to thinking about a range of social-anxiety-provoking experiences (not only a speech task as we originally thought) and to a nonundergraduate sample.  <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title15"> Study 6 </div>

        <div class="body15">

         Although we included trait social anxiety as a covariate in Studies 2–5, we did not examine whether this variable interacted with condition in any of these studies because our statistical power to observe significant interactions in each study was low, considerably lower than our power to detect significant main effects. To overcome this limitation, we performed a meta-analysis in Study 6 on the data from Studies 2–5. Specifically, we examined whether trait social anxiety interacted with condition to predict the following dependent measures, which were assessed in more than one study: anticipatory anxiety (Studies 2–4), postmanipulation affect (Studies 2–3), challenge–threat (Studies 4–5), behavior (Studies 2 and 3), and audience perspective taking (Studies 4 and We did not examine the moderating role of trait social anxiety on avoidance because we observed a floor effect on this variable in both of the studies that assessed it. <br> <br>

         Prior research indicates that vulnerable individuals (i.e., those who score high on individual difference measures of depression or bipolar disorder) benefit as much, or more, from reflecting on emotional experiences from a visual self-distanced perspective as nonvulnerable individuals. Extrapolating from these findings, we expected people who scored high on trait social anxiety to benefit as much or more from engaging in non-first-person self-talk as people who scored low on trait social anxiety on each of the dependent measures we examined.   <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title16"> Results </div>

        <div class="body16">

         The translational relevance of the results of this study depends largely on whether participants in our samples represent the full spectrum of social anxiety scores. Ideally, one would want to have a sufficient number of individuals who scored low and high on trait social anxiety to draw inferences about the generalizability of this work. Therefore, we first examined whether trait social anxiety scores in each study were normally distributed and covered the range of possible scores on the trait social anxiety scales we administered.    <br> <br>

        </div>
        
        <div class="hl2"> </div>

        <div class="title17"> Basic Science Implications </div>

        <div class="body17">

          In addition to highlighting the causal implications of language use during introspection for self-regulation, these findings extend research on self-distancing in three ways. First, no previous research has examined how people can self-distance to regulate anxiety surrounding impending social stressors or examined whether individual differences in social anxiety moderate this process. The current findings address these issues directly. They suggest that self-distancing manipulations may be useful in help- ing people cope not only with depression and anger related to ruminating over the past but also social anxiety surrounding the future. <br> <br>

          Second, the current research demonstrates that self-distancing influences people’s tendency to appraise upcoming social stressors in more challenging and less threatening terms. In so doing, this work integrates research on self-distancing with a large literature on coping and appraisals. <br> <br>

          Third, prior research has relied exclusively on visual imagery techniques to examine the role self-distancing plays in <span class="underline2">self-control</span><sup>4</sup>. The current findings extend this work by demonstrating that language can be harnessed to promote self-distancing as well. Al- though these different self-distancing tactics are clearly related (see Studies 1a and 1b), it would be a mistake (in our view) to conceptualize them as equivalent for two reasons. First, although linguistic self-distancing significantly influenced visual self- distancing in Studies 1a and 1b, it explained only 8% (on average) of the variance in participants’ visual self-distancing scores. If these tactics were identical, then one would have expected the percentage of variance explained to be much higher. Second, it is possible that one self-distancing tactic might work better than another in certain contexts. For example, in circumstances where people have the time and luxury to close their eyes and reflect on a painful past experience, the visual self-distancing tactic might be most useful. However, this tactic may be difficult to implement “online” when people are in the midst of performing a task or interacting with other people. In such situations, linguistic self-talk techniques may be easier to implement. A key challenge for future research is to examine when and why different self-distancing tactics are maximally effective. <br> <br>

          Another important issue to address in future work are the causal pathways that underlie the effects of non-first-person self-talk on the different outcomes we assessed in these studies—anticipatory anxiety, challenge–threat appraisals, performance under stress, postperformance affect, and postevent processing. On the one hand, our findings regarding challenge-threat appraisals provide initial clues about the processes that may explain some of the benefits of non-first-person self-talk on self-regulation. Specifically, prior research indicates that experimentally enhancing challenge-threat appraisals enhances performance under stress and reduces post performance distress and perseveration. Thus, it is possible that non-first-person self-talk impacted performance under stress and postmanipulation affect and perseveration via its effects on appraisals. Future research is needed to verify this, however, to confirm these inferences and rule out alternative causal pathways. <br> <br>

          On the other hand, the causal relationships between some of the other variables we assessed in these studies are less clear. The design we employed did not allow us to examine whether anticipatory affect mediates the effect of condition on appraisals, or vice versa, or whether the relationship between these variables is bidirectional. Addressing this question in the future is important for refining our understanding of how self-talk impacts self-regulation and will require designs that continuously or semicontinuously measure affect and appraisals over time to allow for reciprocal and recursive relationships to emerge. <br> <br>

          It is also possible—and we suspect likely—that non-first-person language use enhances self-control through additional mechanisms that we did not assess. For example, it may influence people’s autonomic reactions to stress and how they strategically deploy their attention before, during, and after stressful tasks. Future research is needed to examine whether these and other theoretically relevant variables play an additional role in explaining how non-first-person language use influences self-regulation. <br> <br>

        </div>

        <div class="title18"> Implications for Socially Anxious Individuals </div>

        <div class="body18"> 

          These findings have multiple implications for research and theory on social anxiety, as well as coping more generally. With respect to social anxiety, they highlight the effect that shifting the language people use to refer to the self under stress has on the cascade of events during and after a social interaction. In this vein, the fact that we observed beneficial effects of non-first-person language use on postevent processing—a cognitive process that has been linked with maladaptive psychological and physical health outcomes in both healthy and clinical populations—is particularly noteworthy. It suggests that the current findings may have broad implications for self-control research and practice in multiple populations. <br> <br>

          An interesting question for future research concerns whether stable individual differences characterize the spontaneous use of non-first-person language to refer to the self during introspection. The Lebron James interview provides anecdotal evidence suggest- ing that some people spontaneously think about the self using non-first-person pronouns and their own name under stressful circumstances. Consistent with this anecdote, a recent study by Zell, Warriner, and Albarracin (2012) demonstrated that people are more likely to use second-person pronouns (compared with first- person pronouns) when thinking about situations that involve self-control than those that do not. Whether the spontaneous use of non-first-person pronouns during self-talk translates into enhanced self-regulation, however, remains unclear, as does whether certain populations of individuals (i.e., healthy vs. clinical) differentially engage in this process. <br> <br>

          When considering the broader implications of these findings, it is noteworthy that our manipulation was quite simple—partici- pants were told to use their own name and other non-first-person pronouns when reflecting over their feelings. That such a small shift in the way people reflected on the self led to such consistent results suggests that taking the next steps to examine how these strategies operate in daily life and generalize to clinical popula- tions may be worthwhile. <br> <br>

          Finally, it is important to recognize that we studied self- distancing in a particular context in this study—one in which participants were asked to self-distance and then analyze their feelings. We focused on the joint operation of self-distancing and “asking why” because previous research has consistently shown that self-distancing in the service of fulfilling such epistemic needs leads to beneficial outcomes. However, it is also possible for people to self-distance to achieve other goals. For example, a person could self-distance to observe his or her feelings, an approach that mindfulness and acceptance-based therapies advocate. They could also self-distance to avoid their emotions, a process that many researchers would characterize as harmful. These examples suggest that whether self-distancing is helpful or harmful may depend critically on how people focus on the self and their emotions once they engage in this process. <br> <br>

          This is especially true for social anxiety because some research indicates that when socially anxious individuals imagine future stressful social interactions, they spontaneously put themselves in the shoes of an evaluative audience, suggesting that self-distancing is harmful for people with <span class="underline3">social anxiety</span><sup>5</sup> (e.g., Schultz & Heim- berg, 2008). However, the current research clearly demonstrates that self-distancing, when used to understand one’s emotions, is quite distinct from focusing on the self from the perspective of an evaluative audience (i.e., what socially anxious people spontaneously do) and has beneficial downstream consequences for cognition, affect, and behavior. Nevertheless, more research is needed to replicate these effects in both undergraduate and nonundergraduate samples characterized by clinical social anxiety.  <br> <br>

        <div class="title20"> Concluding Comment </div>


        <div class="body20"> 

          Self-talk is a ubiquitous human phenomenon. We all have an internal monologue that we engage in from time to time. The current research demonstrates that small shifts in the language people use to refer to the self as they engage in this process consequentially influences their ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior under social stress, even for people who are dispositionally vulnerable to social anxiety.  <br> <br> <br> <br>
